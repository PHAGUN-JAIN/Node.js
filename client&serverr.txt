when we browse the internetwork the browser(client) makes request to other side hosting software(server)
now for communication to take place both applications aggress on some rules of communication (http,ftp,etc)
the way or set of rules followed to structure data is called http, ftp etc,
now ,after that there is another protocol/ set of rules for transferring thonse structured packets to other side
known as tcp

now, suppose you are hosting a server how would you know the request made my the client is for node or any other softwarre
the answer to that is , every program runnig on a computer listens to a request on a parrticular poort no.


now how requests and response actually gets excchanged

like html page where we have a head section which provides additional information to browser
but, do not show on actual page quite same is with requests and responses when client requests
the request goes to the server as aa combinition of request and request header the purpose of these
headers is to provide additional information to the server like content type, status
and same goes with the responses they are combination of response + response headers
